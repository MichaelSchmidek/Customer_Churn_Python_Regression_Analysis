# Telco Customer Churn Analysis (Regression using Python)

The purpose of this project is to explore a customer database from Kaggle using Python in order to draw actionable insights about customer churn.

The database being used is drawn from a Telco company. For the purposes of our analysis, we will be seeking to understand what attributes drive churn (Tenure? Type of service being purchased?) and then seeking to build models that predict which customers will provide recurring revenue over a lifetime. This will inform how to market to customers going forward.

Using Python, we prepare the data, clean it, perform exploratory analysis, and answer interesting questions.

Thanks for reading!
